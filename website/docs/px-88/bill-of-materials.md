# Bill of Materials

These are the components you'll need to build the PX-88. I've linked to the manufacturer, Adafruit, or Amazon, where I purchased most of my parts. Often the Amazon link will be a set of multiple variants/sizes, so you may be able to find the same part individually elsewhere. If you can find get the parts at [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/), please consider supporting them.

| **MK Point65 PCB**                                 | I chose the multi-layout version, however the RGB version should also work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [mechanicalkeyboards.com](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/products/mk-point65-pcb?variant=49801892331820)            |

| **Keyboard Switches - Cherry MX Compatible (x70)** | You can of course get whatever type of switches you prefer. But since there is no plate for the switches, just make sure you get switches that have 5 pins (the extra two plastic pins on the sides) for better stability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [mechanicalkeyboards.com](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/products/cherry-mx2a-blue-60g-clicky)                      |
| **Keycaps - MX Compatible (x70)**                  | Flat profiles like DSA or XDA match the portable computer aesthetic well and are more flexible since they don't need to go in a specific row. But any MX compatible keycaps will work. Note that if you get the linked 60% modifiers, you'll still need a `1.75U Shift`, a `1U Fn`, and the four `1U` keys you want on the right (typically `Del` or `Home`, `PgUp`, `PgDn`, and `End`). The "Alternate" kit will cover that and hopefully comes back in stock. | [spkeyboards.com](https://spkeyboards.com/products/dsa-dolch?variant=49434848428310)                                 |
| **Short USB-C to USB-A Cable**                     | I had one in my hoarded cables that I was able to use. It just has to reach from the keyboard to the Pi, so it can be quite short: ~150mm (6 in).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [adafruit.com](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4472)                                                                |
