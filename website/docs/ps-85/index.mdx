# Typeframe PS-85

The PS-85 is a rugged barebones portable computer inspired by the Alien universe.

Before I built the [PX-88](../px-88/), I tried to modify the awesome [Penkesu](https://penkesu.computer) by Penk Chen to fit a hot-swap keyboard PCB. While I was somewhat successful, I wasn't happy with the result and it lost the charm of the original. After pivoting to the PX-88, I still had the working guts from my Penkesu experiment - so I decided to design a simple slate-style case around it. You'll find the parts and wiring are very similar the Penkesu with a couple of additions.

### Features

- **Carrying Handle**: A sturdy handle for easy transport.
- **Exposed GPIO**: Access to all GPIO pins for tinkering or adding your own HATs.
- **[MU/TH/UR](https://avp.fandom.com/wiki/MU/TH/UR_6000) LED Matrix**: An optional 9x16 LED matrix, just for fun.
- **Mechanical Keyboard**: A 40% keyboard with hot-swappable switches.
- **One Power Connection**: A Micro USB port that powers the device _and_ charges the battery.
- **Raspberry Pi Zero W:**: Low power and compact.

### Caveats

- **Lite OS**: With a Pi Zero you're likely going to want to run Raspberry Pi OS Lite and have a command-line only interface.
- **No Touch Screen**: While the screen supports touch, it requires a separate USB connection. (Doesn't matter if you're using the Lite OS anyway.)
- **No Hardware Screen Brightness**: The HDMI screen doesn't allow brightness control like a DSI screen.
