# Typeframe PX-88

The PX-88 is a portable-ish computer inspired by the [Epson PX-4](https://www.homecomputermuseum.nl/en/collectie/epson/epson-px-4). The goal was to create a writerdeck that could be used with modern web-based editors.

This is my first time building something of this scope, especially with CAD and electronics. I've tried to document everything in detail, so someone like myself with limited experience can tackle the project as well. If I can do it, you can too!

### Features

- **Mechanical Keyboard**: A detachable 65% keyboard with hot-swappable switches.
- **Touch Screen**: No mouse needed.
- **One Power Connection**: A USB-C port that powers the device _and_ charges the battery.
- **Raspberry Pi 4 B:** Powerful enough to run web-based editors like Google Docs.
- **Software Setup**: A distraction-free launcher, boot splash images, and setup for keyboard shortcuts for screen brightness.
- **Easy to Build**: Minimal soldering required (just the power switch and status light!)
