# Typeframe PX-88

<Image img={require("./img/typeframe-px-88-01.jpg")} />

The PX-88 is a portable-ish computer inspired by the [Epson PX-4](https://www.homecomputermuseum.nl/en/collectie/epson/epson-px-4). The goal was to create a writerdeck/cyberdeck that could be used with modern web-based editors. It could be considered a distraction-free writerdeck as doing anything other than writing is a bit cumbersome.

This is my first project of this scope, especially with CAD and electronics, so you may find some puzzling choices and general messiness throughout.

### Features

- **Large Mechanical Keyboard**: A detachable 65% keyboard with hot-swappable switches.
- **Touch Screen**: No mouse needed.
- **One Power Connection**: A USB-C port that powers the device _and_ charges the battery.
- **Raspberry Pi 4 B:** Powerful enough to run web-based editors like Google Docs.
- **Software Setup**: A low-distraction laucher, boot splash images, and set up for keyboard shortcuts for screen brightness.
- **Easy to Build**: Minimal soldering required (just the power switch and status light!)
